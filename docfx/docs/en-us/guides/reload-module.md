# Reload Module

Reloading a module is a common requirement, for example when you've made changes and want them to take effect immediately.  
The operation is simple: just compile your new version of the module to the `{CS2}/game/sharp/modules/{your module}/reload` directory, as shown in the image:

Inside is the package you want to use for reloading, as shown in the image:

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `{CS2}/game/sharp/modules/{your module}/{your module}`, depending on your preference.

Then you can change the map.
