# Physics Query (Native)

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use `PhysicsQueryManager` to perform Trace operations.

> [!TIP]
>
> **Native** provides engine-native exports and APIs, but they are slightly more complex to use.  
> **Wrapper** has slightly lower performance than the **Native** version, and the encapsulation limits flexibility.  
> If you need ready-to-use APIs, please use the **Wrapper** version: [Documentation](./trace-wrapper.md).
